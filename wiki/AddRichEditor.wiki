1). find the id of the textarea you want to replace. in this case, I will use "description" as the id.

2). include <%@ include file="/common/taglibs.jsp" %>

3). add the following after the head tag

<script type="text/javascript">
  window.onload = function() {
	  CKEDITOR.replace( 'description' );
  }
</script>


note: it seems Chrome doesn't support this rich Edit well. it display anomaly.
